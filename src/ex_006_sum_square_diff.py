Sum square difference
Problem 6
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Mathing it, and looking at https://trans4mind.com/personal_development/mathematics/series/sumNaturalSquares.htm
sum of squares = (n)(n+1)(2n+1)/6
square of sums is square((n+1)*n/2)
